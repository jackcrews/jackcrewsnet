<h1>Welcome to Jack's Playground</h1>
<p>Welcome to my playground. This site is intended to be a place to provide people information
about me and about the technologies I'm playing with. I need an environment where I could learn
new things and make them available for reference. Hopefully you will find some of the things I'm
doing interesting.</p>
<p>This site will mostly be related to my professional life but there will certainly be some
personal information here too. I'll try to keep my blog updated with how I've created the things on
this site. You are free to "use" the ideas and solutions I post on this site.</p>
