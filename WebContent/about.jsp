<h1>Who is Jack Crews anyway?</h1>
<h2>Software Craftsman</h2>
<p>By profession I have focused my career on becoming a software craftsman. Engineer doesn't
really describe what I do nor does programmer. What I do is apply logic, experience, art and
intuition to create solutions and solve problems to create software.</p>
<img class="embeddedPhoto" alt="Picture of Jack Crews" src="/images/jackandjoseph.jpg" />
<p>Over the years I have focused on a set of principles and practices known as Agile or eXtreme
Programming (XP). I've found that when I discipline myself to apply these practices that I am the
most productive.</p>
<h2>Family</h2>
<p>Although I enjoy my profession a great deal, my family always takes priority! I married Katie
November 20, 1999 and we are the proud parents of 4 children. We have 3 daughters and a son.</p>
<h2>Home</h2>
<p>I've lived in Colorado, Idaho, Utah, Finland, Washington, and Kansas for at least some period
of time. I grew up in Loveland, CO so I will always consider Colorado home in one way or another.
Right now I live in Dacono, CO which is just a bedroom community north of Denver.</p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>Of course I'm interested in technology but I also enjoy other things such as aviation. I took flying lessons for a short time
many years ago but that didn't last long. It's a very expensive hobby. I was an Eagle scout as a
youth so occasionally I like to go camping or go on some outdoor adventure.</p>
